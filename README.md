# match_score_prediction_model

This repository contains a cricket match score prediction model built using machine learning techniques. We explore three different algorithms: linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. The goal is to predict the total score of a cricket team based on various features.

# Introduction
In this project, we aim to predict the total runs scored by a cricket team in an innings. Cricket match scores depend on factors such as batting order, pitch conditions, weather, and player performance. Our model leverages historical data to make accurate predictions.

# Data
Describe the dataset used for training and testing the model. Include details about the features (input variables) and the target variable (total runs).

# Features
Explain the features used in the model. Some potential features could be:

Batting team
Bowling team
Venue
Number of wickets fallen
Overs played
Player performance (individual scores, strike rate, etc.)
Model Building
Briefly describe the three algorithms used:
